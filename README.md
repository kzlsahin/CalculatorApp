# Calculator

I have created this calculater to exercise on Winform development.

I have implemented a prompter to be used as a debugging tool.

I developed and implemented a unique Arithmetic Evaluator which is capable of handling default multiplications without '*' characater; 
like parantehis next to numbers ( 3(4 + 2) = 18) and squareroot next to a number.

Test sets are used to test the arithmetic evaluator and UI of the app also. Test driven development is a must especailly this kind of complex processes.
