# Calculator

I have created this calculater to exercise on Winform development.

I have implemented a prompter to be used as a debugging tool.

I developed and implemented a unique Arithmetic Evaluator which is capable of handling default multiplications without '*' char, like parantehis next to numbers ( 3(4 + 2) = 18) and squareroot next to a number.
